# My Personal Project: Property Maintenance Logbook

## Maintenance Application:

The application will function similarly to a maintenance logbook for a rental property owner wishing 
to track and update the predetermined conditions of a property. This project is of interest to me because 
it has a practical application, and I would likely use it in the future myself 
if I'm able to invest in a rental property.


The **user stories** included:
- As a user, I want to be able to add inspection to a property
- As a user, I want to be able to view all inspections in a property
- As a user, I want to view an inspection by date for a property
- As a user, I want to be able to save my property to file
- As a user, I want to be able to save my inspection to file
- As a user, I want to be able to reload an inspection from file, and resume where I left off


# Phase 3: Instructions for Grader

- You can generate the first required event by clicking the button labelled "Add Property to Log Book", then 
  clicking "View All Properties" to view the properties that have already been added to the log book
- You can generate the second required event by clicking the button labelled "Add Inspection to Property", then viewing 
  the inspections within the json file
- You can locate my visual component by starting the application which presents an image of a log book
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the "Save Properties/Inspections" button
  to load/save data to/from file
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking "Load Properties/Inspections" button followed by the "View All Properties" button

# Phase 4: Task 3
- I would refactor the LogbookGUI class such that the constructor and setupMenu methods would have lines of code extracted out
  to reduce the number of lines and have them call those methods instead to increase readability
