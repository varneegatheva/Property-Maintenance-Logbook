# My Personal Project: Property Maintenance Logbook

## Maintenance Application:

The application will function similarly to a maintenance logbook for a rental property owner wishing 
to track and update the predetermined conditions of a property. This project is of interest to me because 
it has a practical application, and I would likely use it in the future myself 
if I'm able to invest in a rental property.


The **user stories** included:
- As a user, I want to be able to add inspection to a property
- As a user, I want to be able to view all inspections in a property
- As a user, I want to view an inspection by date for a property
- As a user, I want to be able to save my property to file
- As a user, I want to be able to save my inspection to file
- As a user, I want to be able to reload an inspection from file, and resume where I left off
