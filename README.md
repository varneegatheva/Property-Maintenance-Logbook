# My Personal Project: Property Maintenance Tracket

## Maintenance Application:

The application will function similarly to a maintenance logbook for a rental property owner wishing 
to track and update the predetermined conditions of a property. This project is of interest to me because 
it has a practical application, and I would likely use it in the future myself 
if I'm able to invest in a rental property.


The **user stories** included:
- add a date stamped log entry to the book list
- view my list of entries in the list
- delete an entry from my list
- select and view an entry from my list
